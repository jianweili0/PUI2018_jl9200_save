This map looks great as far as representing the quantities it is trying to represent goes. I would hope for the background color of the first 
plot to be a little less "subdued". In terms of selecting the right colors for free WIFI and limited WIFI, I think again, 
the plot could be served right, if more “robust” colors were used. And for the legend I think we could be a little more intuitive; 
for example we could bundle the twelve providers into two groupings. May be use a dictionary for a key value combination ?
And the number of WIFI hot spots would make one curious as to how these hots spots are shared among the eight or so providers
in each grouping.
