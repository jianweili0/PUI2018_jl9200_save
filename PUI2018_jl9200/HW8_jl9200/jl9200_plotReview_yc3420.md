There are two plots in Jianweiâ€™s assignment 1. Both of them are geospatial image and the data source is related to urban. As for clarity, those two images did a great work. According to the code, the two plots are both reproducible. There are legend, title, and caption attached to the images which made the image more readable. For the second one, there is only legend for the choropleth map. Although Jianwei noted in the title about what orange and yellow dots stand for, it is better to add a second legend for the reader. 
  
    
    
I like the color maps that Jianwei chose for both images and they are color blind friendly choices. However, it is hard to identify the dot on the map when the dots are not that concentrated due to the dot size. Jianwei might want to use a larger dot size to for better readability. Moreover, for the second choropleth map, 10 bins might be too much for distinguishing. The final general suggestion is that, both different color and different shape could be used in distinguishing features to improve the quality of the image.
