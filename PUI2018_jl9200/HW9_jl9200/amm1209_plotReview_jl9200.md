In this chart, I can see crystal clear about the distribution of birthyear of citibike rider between 1920 and 2000. I beleve Ana use an really efficient way to fit the line with the data using stats.norm.fit model. She choice a right model, because as we can see the histogram of birthyear range fall into gaussian distribution with some skew towards the age around 1980 to 1995. I beleve show can expand this analysis with maybe a one-year dataset if possible, so we can understand if there are trend of the seasons will effect the analysis. Also, using mlab.normpdf(x, *args) is a simply way to display normal pdf for the input data. I really admire the way she coded and the plot she made is self-explanatory.
